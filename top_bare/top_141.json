Nalbinding, or sometimes called \"naalbinding\" roughly translates to \"needle binding\" or \"knotless knitting\" depending who you ask and it is a sort of ancestor to modern knitting. Nalbinding was used during the Viking-age of 793-1066 AD in Scandinavia before knitting and crochet were known and the most popular techniques used now come from that particular era.",
